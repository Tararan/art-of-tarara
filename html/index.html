                        I am an artist and a frontend web developer from Zagreb, Croatia. That essentially means I create websites and I create characters.
                        <br/> 
                        <br/>
                        If you want to hire me to build you a website, to turn you sketch or PSD into a HTML/CSS, head over the the Web Design.
                        <br/>
                        If you want to hire me as an artist ( if you are not sure what I can do for you, check out  my portfolio on deviant, facebook or instagram) go to the art section and send me a message.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Most of the time I can be found sitting hunched over a laptop in bars in Zagreb irritating the waiters by sipping my cup of coffee for far too long.

                        Well, I was drawing probably before I even knew who I was. For me, drawing was a way to make sense of the world, although it never really did. As a grown up I just realised that this universe is full of nonsense and unsolved mysteries that will never be known and I accepted that.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> So, even though I enjoyed creating new characters and stories, what I loved even more was putting people together with their heroes and putting them in worlds they could visit only temporarily through their laptop screens or pages of their favourite books.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> I decided to give them a snapshot, a painting of their experience and so far the feedback was great. If you are interested in hiring me for your creative project whether it be for comic book, children illustration books, book covers, or anything that requires painting or drawing digitally, go the art section.

                        Few years ago, I worked on odd jobs until I met a friend of mine that worked in frontend development and as I talked to him and I saw what he did for a living, a light bulb turned on inside of my head.
                        <br/> As I researched more, and got comfortable with html and css, and later got familiar with bootstrap and sass I realised there was something quite liberating in getting inside of code and changing everything to my liking.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> Soon, I could see flaws in websites, big and small and I could see the fixes needed and the ways they could be improved.
                        <br/> Many websites today (I have noticed) suffer from poor design. That is probably becomes many web developers are great analysts.
                        <br/> They can pinpoint the problem and solve it, just not in an aesthetically pleasant way.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <i>My advantage</i> is that before touching any code I had a couple of years of experience of playing with colours and testing what colour schemes and themes attract people the most.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> <span class="main__txt-strong">I see websites as connected pieces of modern art.</span>
                        <br/> They represent you, and your brand. Websites are like clothes you wear, or decorations you use to make your office space look better.
                        <br/> Website is most often the first thing a potential customer sees about your brand, it is your <i>first impression</i> and it needs to be good, it needs to look good.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> If you are interested in doing a website with me, be it it turning psd files into html or starting a website from scratch, I got your back.
                        <br/> If you are on a budget, check out website on a budget section under web development
